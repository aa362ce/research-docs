## How to remove services not listed under launch items?

There are two locations for these, one is for Apple daemons only: 

`/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`

The other is to include 3rd party processes:  
`/Library/LaunchDaemons`

You may also need to remove from:  
`/Library/LaunchAgents`

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
